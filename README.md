# Hello, Go! 👋

Welcome to my Go learning journey!  
Today, I wrote my very first Go program — the classic "Hello, World!"

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to install and set up the Go environment
- How to write a basic Go program
- The structure of a Go program:
  - `package main`
  - `import` statements
  - `func main()` as the entry point

## 📄 File
- `hello.go` — prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal

## 🔧 How to Run
Make sure Go is installed. Then:

```bash
go run hello.go
