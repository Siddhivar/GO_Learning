# Hello, Go!

Welcome to my Go learning journey!  
Today, I wrote my very first Go program â€” the classic "Hello, World!"

## What I Learned
- How to install and set up the Go environment
- How to write a basic Go program
- The structure of a Go program:
  - `package main`
  - `import` statements
  - `func main()` as the entry point

## File
- `Hello.go` â€” prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
Make sure Go is installed. Then:

```bash
go run Hello.go
