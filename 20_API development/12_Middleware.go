/*
Think of middleware like layers of security and processing steps before or after your main handler runs.
In real life, imagine youâ€™re entering an office:
First, a security guard checks your ID.
Then a receptionist guides you to the right department.
Finally, you meet the person you actually came to see (your main handler).

Middleware in Go does the same:
Before your handler runs, it can log requests, authenticate users, validate data, etc.
After the handler, it might log responses or modify headers.
